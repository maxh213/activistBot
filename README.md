# activistBot

THIS BOT IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY ORGANISATION. Purely just me automating what I'd tweet anyway. 

kind of an experiment in passing a turing test but also helping out animals at the same time. I've tried to give the bot generic interests other than activism that'll retweet (like marvel movies).

# TODO:
* EMAIL me the log outputs when running
* create a campaign object
* create a target object
* improve sentence structure on the cat images
* add generic interests and make it tweet / steal tweets about them
* double check the in reply to functionality
* auto reply when certain accounts tweet
⋅⋅* all the time
⋅⋅* some of the time
