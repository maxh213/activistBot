# activistBot

kind of an experiment in passing a turing test but also helping out animals at the same time. I've tried to give the bot generic interests other than activism that'll retweet (like marvel movies) so people don't think it's a bot.

# TODO:
* retweet/fave from timeline list
* EMAIL me the log outputs when running
* create a campaign object
* create a target object
* improve sentence structure on the cat images
* add generic interests and make it tweet / steal tweets about them
* double check the in reply to functionality
